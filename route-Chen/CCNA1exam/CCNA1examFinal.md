- check domain site ping and nslookup
- check running-config for ipv6 unicast-routing
- Given network 172.18.109.0, which subnet mask would be used if 6 host bits were available?
6 host bits!
6 host bits!
6 host bits!
- switch reply ARP to router interface
- Which two acronyms represent the data link sublayers that Ethernet relies upon to operate? (Choose two.)LLC,MAC

- Cisco IOS switches have physical ports for devices to connect to, but also have one or more switch virtual interfaces (SVIs).These are virtual interfaces, because there is no physical hardware on the device associated with them, rather they are created in software.The virtual interface provides a means to remotely manage a switch over a network that is using IP.Each switch comes with one SVI appearing in the default configuration "out-of-the-box." The default SVI is interface VLAN1.The no shutdown command needs to be issued to activate this interface.
- kernel : the part of the OS that interacts directly with the device hardware
- GUI : enables the user to interact with the operating system by pointing and clicking
- shell : the part of the operating system that interfaces with applications and the user
- CLI : users interact with the operating system by typing commands
- OSI = TCP/IP = nework(L3) and transport(L4)
- Which PDU is processed when a host computer is de-encapsulating a message at the transport layer of the TCP/IP model? packet
- Which two statements describe the characteristics of fiber-optic cabling? (Choose two.) backbone network and not electicity.
- A network team is comparing topologies for connecting on a shared media. Which physical topology is an example of a hybrid topology for a LAN? extended star
- Routers are responsible for encapsulating a frame with the proper format for the physical network media they connect. At each hop along the path, a router does the following:
1. Accepts a frame from a medium
2. De-encapsulates the frame
3. Determines the best path to forward the packet
4. Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame
5. Forwards the new frame appropriate to the medium of that segment of the physical network
- What routing table entry has a next hop address associated with a destination network?remote routes
- Which two ICMP messages are used by both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols? (Choose two.)â€‹The ICMP messages common to both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 include: host confirmation, destination (net, host, protocol, port) or service unreachable, time exceeded, and route redirection.Router solicitation, neighbor solicitation, and router advertisement are new protocols implemented in ICMPv6.
- The window size specifies the amount of data that can be sent before an acknowledgment is received from the receiver. This value specifies the highest number of bytes, not the required number of bytes.
At a minimum, a computer should use antivirus software and have all software up to date to defend against malware.
- The company connects to the Internet through a leased line service to an ISP. Which approach best provides cost effective redundancy for the Internet connection?With a separate DSL connection to another ISP, the company will have a redundancy solution for the Internet connection, in case the leased line connection fails. The other options provide other aspects of redundancy, but not the Internet connection.The options of adding a second NIC and adding multiple connections between the switches and the edge router will provide redundancy in case one NIC fails or one connection between the switches and the edge router fails.The option of adding another web server provides redundancy if the main web server fails.
- Which two issues can cause both runts and giants in Ethernet networks? (Choose two.)a malfunctioning NIC,half-duplex operations
