**Class A (0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8)** - Designed to support extremely large networks with more than 16 million host addresses. Class A used a fixed /8 prefix with the first octet to indicate the network address and the remaining three octets for host addresses (more than 16 million host addresses per network).

**Class B (128.0.0.0 /16 - 191.255.0.0 /16)** - Designed to support the needs of moderate to large size networks with up to approximately 65,000 host addresses. Class B used a fixed /16 prefix with the two high-order octets to indicate the network address and the remaining two octets for host addresses (more than 65,000 host addresses per network).

**Class C (192.0.0.0 /24 - 223.255.255.0 /24)** - Designed to support small networks with a maximum of 254 hosts. Class C used a fixed /24 prefix with the first three octets to indicate the network and the remaining octet for the host addresses (only 254 host addresses per network).

### 11.3.6 Assignment of IP Addresses
Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The IANA manages and allocates blocks of IP addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). The five RIRs are shown in the figure.

IANA => RIRs => APNIC => TWNIC

# 11.5.5 Packet Tracer - Subnet an IPv4 Network
```
Objectives 
In this scenario, you are a network technician assigned to install a new network for a customer. You must 
create multiple subnets out of the 192.168.0.0/24 network address space to meet the following requirements: 
a. The first subnet is the LAN-A network. You need a minimum of 50 host IP addresses. 
b. The second subnet is the LAN-B network. You need a minimum of 40 host IP addresses. 
c. You also need at least two additional unused subnets for future network expansion.
```

## Calculate IPv4 Subnets

Problem 1:  
```
Given: 
Host IP Address: 10.101.99.228 
Original Subnet Mask 255.0.0.0 
New Subnet Mask: 255.255.128.0 

Find: 

Number of Subnet Bits 
9
Number of Subnets Created 
2^9
Number of Host Bits per Subnet 
15
Number of Hosts per Subnet 
2^16-2
 
Network Address of this Subnet 

IPv4 Address of First Host on this Subnet 
10.0.0.1
 
IPv4 Address of Last Host on this Subnet 
10.255.128.255
 
IPv4 Broadcast Address on this Subnet 
10.101.99.0

```


Problem 2:
```
Given:
Host IP Address:	10.101.99.228
Original Subnet Mask	255.0.0.0
New Subnet Mask:	255.255.128.0

my solution
mask:.[11111111].[10000000].
ip  :.[011].

```

Problem 3:
```
minimum hosts : 25
subnet: 4+1 , two subs and one for switches
origin mask /24
new mask /27
then have 8 sub nets and 30 hosts.
